# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. You’ll gain a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

## Technologies and Techniques Used

- **Node.js** - JavaScript runtime environment
- **Express.js** - Web framework for building the REST API
- **MongoDB** - NoSQL database for data storage
- **Mongoose** - MongoDB object modeling library
- **ESLint with Airbnb config** - Code linting and style enforcement
- **Prettier** - Code formatting
- **bcryptjs** - Password hashing
- **jsonwebtoken** - JWT authentication
- **validator** - Data validation library

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing

Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
